I am a senior postdoc fellow at [IMATI](https://www.imati.cnr.it/make_home_page.php?language=ENG&view=GEN) in Genova, an institute of [CNR](https://www.cnr.it/en), working with [Silvia Biasotti](https://imati.cnr.it/mypage.php?idk=PG-67) and [Ulderico Fugacci](https://fugacci.github.io/home/).

I work in Topological Data Analysis, both towards the theory and the applications. I am interested in finding nice representatives for 1-parameter persistence, both in the geometric and the algebraic sense, and in applying these constructions to data. I am also interested in the interaction of TDA with data science per se, especially through differentiation of persistent homology and topological learning. 

I obtained my PhD from Politecnico di Torino in 2022, under the supervision of [Francesco Vaccarino](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4XfzoZQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/). In 2024, I was a postdoc fellow at the [Institut Fourier](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/) of [UGA](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble, working with [RÃ©mi Molinier](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~molinier/).
