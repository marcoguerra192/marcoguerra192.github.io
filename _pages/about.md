I am a Postdoc fellow at the [Institut Fourier](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/) of [UGA](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble. My PI is [RÃ©mi Molinier](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~molinier/).

I work in Topological Data Analysis, both towards the theory and the applications. I am interested in finding nice representatives for 1-parameter persistence, both in the geometric and the algebraic sense, and in applying these constructions to data. I am also interested in the interaction of TDA with data science per se, especially through differentiation of persistent homology and topological learning. 

I obtained my PhD from Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of [Francesco Vaccarino](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4XfzoZQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/).
